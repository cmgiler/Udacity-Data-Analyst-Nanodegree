# Welcome to my Portfolio for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree!

## Links to my projects:
 - [P1. Test a Perceptual Phenomenon](https://github.com/cmgiler/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/1.Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon)
    > Analyzed the Stroop effect using descriptive statistics to provide an intuition about the data, and inferential statistics to draw a conclusion based on the results.
 
 - [P2. Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/cmgiler/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/2.Investigate-a-Dataset)
    > Posed a question about a dataset, then used NumPy and Pandas to answer that question based on the data and created a report to share the results.

 - [P3. Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data](https://github.com/cmgiler/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/3.Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data)
    > Chose a region (Milwaukee, WI) and used data munging techniques to assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity.

 - [P4. Explore and Summarize Data](https://github.com/cmgiler/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/4.Explore-and-Summarize-Data)
    > Investigated a dataset of white wine chemical properties and quality ratings using R and exploratory data analysis techniques, exploring both single variables and relationships between variables.
 
 - [P5. Identify Fraud from Enron Email](https://github.com/cmgiler/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/5.Identify-Fraud-from-Enron-Email)
    > Identified which Enron employees are more likely to have committed fraud using machine learning and public Enron financial and email data.
 
 - [P6. Data Visualization with D3.js](https://github.com/cmgiler/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/6.Data-Visualization)
    > Created a polished data visualization that tells a story, allowing a reader to explore trends or patterns in U.S. Flight Delays from 2003 to 2016.
 
 - [P7. Designing an A/B Test](https://github.com/cmgiler/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/7.AB-Testing)
    > Designed an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. I also analyzed the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity, recommended a decision, and proposed a follow-up experiment.
